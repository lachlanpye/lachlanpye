CV Tool: https://lachlanpye-cv-tool.herokuapp.com/

This project was made as a solo project with a React frontend, NodeJS backend and uses MySQL for database purposes. It allows users to create an account and log in, and upload their resume / cover letter files and tag them for ease of sorting. The app is hosted on Heroku while the MySQL database is hosted on ClearDB.
